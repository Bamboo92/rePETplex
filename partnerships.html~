        <p>At RePET Global, we view our customers as partners. Our goal is to build long-term relationships that are mutually beneficial. When you work with us, you get more than just a supplier – you get a reliable ally invested in your success. Below are some of the partnership benefits we offer:</p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-4">
        <h2>Flexible Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>Understanding the financial challenges of running a manufacturing business, we offer flexible payment arrangements to approved partners. Depending on the volume and frequency of orders, we can accommodate various payment terms such as <em>Net 30</em> or <em>Net 60</em> days. We are also open to secure methods like Letters of Credit for international transactions. Our aim is to ease cash flow concerns so that obtaining recycled materials is as straightforward as possible for you.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="mb-4">
        <h2>Annual Contracts</h2>
        <p>For customers looking to secure a steady supply of PET flakes, we offer annual (or multi-year) contract agreements. Through a contract, you can lock in a consistent quantity – and potentially pricing – of material over a year. This guarantees that you'll have priority access to our product even during times of high demand. Such agreements help both parties plan ahead: you can rely on scheduled deliveries, and we can organize our production around your needs, ensuring a stable partnership.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Volume Discounts</h2>
        <p>We appreciate our high-volume partners. If you plan to purchase large quantities or commit to a long-term supply, we reflect that commitment in our pricing. Volume discounts are available for bulk orders or extended contracts, making our competitive prices even more attractive. The larger the volume or the longer our partnership, the more value we can provide in terms of cost savings. We are happy to discuss a tiered pricing structure that rewards your business as it grows with us.</p>
