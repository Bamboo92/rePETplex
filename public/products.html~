        <p>Our primary product is <strong>hot-washed PET bottle flakes</strong>, which serve as an excellent raw material for a variety of industrial applications, including polyester fiber production, packaging, and plastic manufacturing. Below are the key specifications and options for our PET flakes:</p>
        <p><strong>Available Colors:</strong> We offer PET flakes in two color grades: <em>Transparent (Clear)</em> and <em>Light Blue</em>. Transparent flakes are derived from clear bottles and have extremely low impurity levels, making them ideal for high-quality end uses. Light Blue flakes come from blue-tinted bottles and are similarly pure, suitable for various recycling processes. We ensure that each batch is consistently sorted by color to meet your requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality &amp; Processing:</strong> Our flakes are thoroughly cleaned and dried during the production process. They have low moisture content (typically &lt; 1%), meaning they are <em>ready for processing without additional drying</em>. You can directly use them in your extruders or other equipment, saving time and energy in your production line. Additionally, we maintain strict quality control to keep contaminant levels (such as PVC or other polymers) to an absolute minimum.</p>
        <p><strong>Packaging:</strong> For safe and efficient transport, PET flakes are packed in large <em>big bags</em> (jumbo sacks) that hold between 800–1000 kg each. These bags are secured on pallets for stability. We typically load 18–20 tons of flakes into a 20-foot shipping container (approximately 18–20 of these big bags per container). This packaging method keeps the material clean and dry during transit and allows for easy handling upon arrival.</p>
        <p><strong>Customization:</strong> We understand that different customers have different needs. We can tailor our sorting process to provide material specific to your requests — for example, exclusively clear or exclusively light blue flakes, or custom mixes. We can also adjust certain production parameters such as flake size or bulk density to suit your manufacturing process. If you have particular specifications (e.g., maximum impurity levels or higher intrinsic viscosity for bottle-grade use), please let us know, and we will strive to meet them.</p>
        <p>All our PET flakes are produced under strict standards to ensure consistency. Whether you are manufacturing textiles, bottles, or plastic sheets, our recycled PET will integrate seamlessly into your supply chain.
