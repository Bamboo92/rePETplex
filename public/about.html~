        <h2>Company Background</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2010 by a team of recycling enthusiasts, RePET Global has grown into a leading provider of recycled PET flakes. What began as a local initiative in Tunisia has expanded into an international operation, supplying partners across Europe and beyond. Our core business is converting post-consumer PET bottles into <strong>high-quality PET flakes</strong> that meet the rigorous standards of manufacturers for fibers, packaging, and other applications.</p>
        <p>Over the years, we have invested in advanced cleaning and processing technology to ensure that our flakes are of consistently high purity and quality. This dedication to excellence has earned us a reputation for reliability and trust in the recycling industry.</p>

        <h2>Our Global Presence</h2>
        <p>RePET Global operates in both North Africa and Europe, bridging supply and demand across continents. Our main recycling facility is strategically located in Tunisia, where we have access to abundant raw materials (used PET bottles) and skilled labor. Here, bottles are collected, sorted, washed, and transformed into clean PET flakes ready for export.</p>
        <p>In addition, we maintain a distribution warehouse in Europe (Germany) to serve our European customers with just-in-time deliveries. By storing product closer to our clients, we can fulfill orders rapidly and offer flexible shipping options. This dual presence enables us to offer competitive pricing and efficient logistics to customers worldwide.</p>
